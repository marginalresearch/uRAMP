## Mission

Provide risk-based insights to reduce uncertainty and improve decision-making.

## Vision

We study the dynamics between cybersecurity threats, organizations, and the safeguards used to protect themselves to identify where risks lie.  We use this to create trustworthy insights to help people understand, mitigate, and adapt to their cybersecurity threats.

## Strategy

A pragmatic risk management strategy is based on the ability to adapt to threats.  Through adaptation it can, confidently, understand and effectively appropriate resources efficiently.  To accomplish this, our models venture to understand, measure, and quantify the risk of intentional and unintentional threats.

Cybersecurity is highly dynamic.  Threats evolve, organizations evolve, and the systems used by both evolve as will our models. For our insights to have value, our data needs to be current and relevant.  To accomplish this, we will open source various datasets and models and promote a community-driven corpus which'll serve as the bedrock for which our models will be built upon.
